# BookWishlist-android
This is a simple book wishlist app which I made from scratch for an assignment, putting it on here because I am very happy with it.
I am including a UML diagram I made for this app as well, but correctness is not guarenteed. 
Thinking about improving this project a lot in the future, so much more left to learn. 
This uses old school Java and XML because thats what the class wanted. I personally would have liked to use Kotlin, but Java isn't too bad at this scale. 
Jetpack Compose would have been the best honestly but I really struggle with declarative stuff, much prefer XML layouts, but they do make things more complex than needed.
